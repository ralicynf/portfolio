            <p id='about-me'>
                Hi, I'm Rebecca! I'm a junior full stack software developer with a focus on frontend development. While my background is in biology and the biomedical sciences, software development is where my passion lies. However, my past educational focus provided me with excellent problem solving skills, a very analytical thought process, and impressive research skills. I am passionate about frontend software development, as I most enjoy the creativity that comes with the design and functional aspects of a website or application. There is nothing I enjoy more than sitting down to work on some CSS. 
                <br />

                When it comes to the things I love most outside of software development, I enjoy reading, painting, music, and doing puzzles. While my academic life has been very rooted in science and math, my hobbies have always stemmed around the arts. I think this provides me with a good balance and makes me a well-rounded individual. The creativity that I harbor, which make these hobbies so enjoyable for me, is also the same creativity that makes me an excellent frontend develope. Also, my love of doing puzzles in my free time is very representative of my drive as a developer, as once I sit down to work on a puzzle, I don't stop until I'm finished. My coding style is much the same way in that once I set my mind to a project or working out a bug, there is nothing that can stand in my way!
